To this point, CIS has mainly been studied from an interactional perspective, with very little focus on team cognition. This work focuses on understanding the development of cognitive processes during CIS. More specifically, the cognitive construct, the team mental model, was examined. Teams conducted a CIS task and then cognitive interviews and individual/team concept maps were collected in both face-to-face and distributed conditions. In addition, evaluations of CIS tools were conducted with specific inquiry into understanding what features have the ability to help/hurt team cognition during CIS. Analysis indicated that the development of team cognition is readily apparent during CIS, and that it significantly impacts a teams’ CIS work in many ways."
