Teamwork must occur between and among all three roles for a successful mission to be accomplished. In experiments focused on the synthetic teammate interaction, the Air Vehicle Operator is a cognitively plausible ACT-R based computational model serving as a full fledged teammate."

More specifically, studies in collaboration with university level varsity teams are resulting in a better understanding of how team cognition develops and occurs during team sports. In addition, conceptual pieces and methods for studying team cognition within this context have been published and identified within this overall project."

The success of a team is dependent on the activity of CIS, as the team must find relevant information to accurately and successfully solve a problem. To this point, CIS has mainly been studied from an interactional perspective, with very little focus on team cognition. This work focuses on understanding the development of cognitive processes during CIS. More specifically, the cognitive construct, the team mental model, was examined. Teams conducted a CIS task and then cognitive interviews and individual/team concept maps were collected in both face-to-face and distributed conditions. In addition, evaluations of CIS tools were conducted with specific inquiry into understanding what features have the ability to help/hurt team cognition during CIS. Analysis indicated that the development of team cognition is readily apparent during CIS, and that it significantly impacts a teams’ CIS work in many ways."
