      "Greetings! I am an Assistant Professor and Director of the Team Research Analytics in Computational Environments (TRACE) Research Group within the division of Human-Centered Computing in the School of Computing at Clemson University. I received my PhD in Information Sciences & Technology with a focus on Team Decision Making, Cognition, and Computer Supported Collaborative Work from The Pennsylvania State University in the fall of 2014.",
      "After graduation, I accepted a position to be a Postdoctoral Scholar and Research Associate in Human Systems Engineering at Arizona State University working directly with Dr. Nancy Cooke.",
      "My research interests are wide ranging and interdisciplinary, but can be generally linked to the integration of:\n -Human Factors\n -Human Computer Interaction\n -Computer Supported Cooperative Work\n -Information Sciences",
      "For over 10 years, I have conducted research on many topics within a variety of different contexts. My current research interests span across the study of individual and team cognition, the development and design of human-centered tools and systems, continued development and refinement of cognitive engineering methods, context specific measurement of team cognition, the interplay between team interaction and team cognition, the development and application of unmanned aerial vehicles, and human robot interaction. Specific contexts that I have conducted my research in: healthcare systems, homeland security, command and control, emergency crisis management, and educational learning. Throughout all of my research, I typically use multiple mixed methods to understand the context, work, and roles specific to the development of individual and team cognition. As a result of my work, my research has been published multiple times in numerous research communities.",
